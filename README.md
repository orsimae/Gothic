𝕲𝖔𝖙𝖍𝖎𝖈𝕾𝖈𝖗𝖎𝖕𝖙 is a library for creating JavaScript (ES6) classes where the definition is done with a much more universal structure than the official system.

This definition nicknamed JSUC (JavaScript Understandable Classes) allows declaring access modifiers for classes:
1. public
    1.1 abstract
    1.2 final
   1.3 static
2. protected
3. private

For class members, the classic access modifiers, also GAS support modifiers (get and set) are included:
1. public
    1.1 abstract
    1.2 final
    1.3 getter
    1.4 setter
    1.5 static
2. protected
3. private
4. global (similar to C++ 'friend' modifier)

Classes can be executed in any WEB browser that supports the ES6 standard.
